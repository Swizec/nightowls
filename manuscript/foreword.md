# From disgruntled developer, to founder, to burnout

I was 21 when I quit my first real job.

What started as a great opportunity for a high school senior to sharpen his coding chops turned into daily frustration over poor management and terrible working conditions.

The small advertising agency was a creative's dream. Large windows overlooking a lush green park, playful decor, walls covered in old design projects, sofas in the lounge, shelves full of books on design and marketing. A relaxed culture.

At first I was happy. The work was fun, it was new, and I even got paid to do what I loved. Jackpot! But nobody had any real idea how programmers function. How we think, how we work, what we need to feel productive. For a long time I was the only programmer on the team, and it was terrible.

On day one, I was given an old laptop, a comfy chair and a spot at the large desk occupying most of an open-floor office. Across from me was a chatty copywriter. On the right was the main designer. In the opposite corner sat another designer.

Hidden just behind a tall bookshelf was our boss. When anyone went to ask him about something, the whole office could hear. Eventually a project manager joined our big desk, and she was twice as loud. Apparently, printers often need to be shouted at to get a move on.

The months passed, and the job became more and more stressful. The projects became monotonous. Waves upon waves of client work made it completely impossible to work on that one cool internal project. By the time I was finishing up coding for the previous project, a new one was ready to go.  I never had time to attend meetings, so I never had a say in designing projects.

At one point there were so many things on my plate I couldn't even get more than a half hour of focused work done until everyone went home for the day.

Word of Google being a super awesome place to work for reached my radar at about the same time. A company by engineers for engineers. A place you can _work_ at.

I started dreaming of founding the perfect company to work for. I didn't know what that meant, but I knew it was going to be cool and I would love working there.

After a few months of working on a side-project late into the night I quit my job and started working from home. Finally I could focus on whatever I wanted! Nobody to boss me around. Nobody to throw me off focus. Nobody to tell me when I should go home.

Except mum. She didn't get this "working from home" thing at all.

"You're home arsing about all morning. What do you mean you can't wash the dishes and vacuum the floor and cook lunch and your room is still a mess?"

"But muuuuum, I was *working*. I don't have time for that stuff. I'm *busy*!"

"Yeah? How much money'd you make then?"

"It's not all about the money mum …"

"Then you're playing, not working!"

Eventually though the side-project started taking off. Two guys agreed to work with me for free. I couldn't really pay them anyway. We convinced a local hackerspace to give us an office - also for free - and we set off to build the next big thing in news consumption. We were going to take over the world!

We didn't.

The startup never left my mind. At any given moment I was either architecting a cool piece of tech, pouring my misguided ideas into code, creating business strategies, thinking about what the others were doing, or learning to be a better entrepreneur.

It got so life-consuming that I was listening to entrepreneurship podcasts whenever I had more than 10 minutes of "free" time, just so I could squeeze that extra bit of productivity into the day. My standard workday was 14 to 15 hours. 

Everyone spent at least eleven hours a day in that dark hackerspace basement. We occupied a sofa, two tables, and three whiteboards.  We wanted to work, work, work. But one by one we crashed and burned.

The other programmer was the first to go. He simply stopped coming to the office. He didn't answer any of my calls or emails. For a few weeks even his friends were asking me if I'd seen him.

I don't know what happened, but he was a cool guy and I still feel bad for putting him through that. Last time we met, he was working for a well-established startup and finishing his studies. He didn't seem to hold a grudge.

He was the first to give up on us, but I was the first to start burning out. I started taking long car rides to nothing. Just sat in the car and drove aimlessly around the city listening to bad music and looking at the stars.

I needed to be away from my responsibilities. Everyone expected me to be awesome, to inspire everyone to work hard, to woo investors, to keep my spirits up, to be perfect.

They actually didn't, but it sure felt like it. In my eyes I _was_ the startup. Without me, there was nothing.  But the car didn't judge.

I became a husk. I spent whole days aimlessly clicking around the internet. "Work" had become writing two lines of code followed by an hour of lolcats. My nights were spent doing everything I could possibly think of that didn't involve the startup.

I had poured my life into the startup for a year and five months, but in March 2011 our investors and the other cofounder kicked me out. Devastated, but I deserved it. I was a terrible boss, I drove my guys like slaves, and I didn't listen to anyone.

On my way out an advisor/investor said: _"Dude, I know this hurts. But you need to learn a lesson."_

_"Screw you, no I don't!"_

But he was right. What I was doing was unreasonable and borderline psychopathic. That is no way to treat programmers. The job I tried so hard to escape wasn't even half as bad as the job I created.

Ever since I have been actively searching for _the_ best way to be a  programmer. _The_ best way to treat programmers. _The_ best environment to keep programmers happy, productive, and sane.

This book is about what I've learned.
