# About flow

Ayrton Senna once described flow as 
> I was already on pole, and I just kept going. Suddenly I was nearly two seconds faster than anybody else, including my team mate with the same car. And suddenly I realised that I was no longer driving the car consciously. I was driving it by a kand of instinct, only it was a different dimension. It was like I was in a tunnel.

[That lap has been described as the greatest lap of Senna's career](http://youtube.com/watch?v=K9QH8-lKEYY).

Flow is a state of complete immersion in an activity, a state where the outside and inside world merge into one and the person is simply _present_. Mihaly Csikszentmihaly - the father of flow research in psychology - describes flow as

> completely focused motivation. A single-minded immersion that represents perhaps the ultimate in harnessing the emotions in service of performing and learning.

In his essay [Holding a program in one's head](http://paulgraham.com/head.html) Paul Graham explains that to be effective, programmers must be able to hold an entire program in their head while they work. It's the only way the problem and its solution can have the plasticity needed to make sweeping changes and improvements.

Because programmers tend to work at the limits of their tolerance for complexity holding a program in one's head is only possible in a state of flow.

But flow is a fragile balance between many opposing forces. The programmer must be willing and able to completely focus on the task at hand, they must have a clear goal to work towards, fresh challenges must be coming in just quickly enough and they must feel a sense of purpose, even joy, in what they're doing.

## The autotelic personality

In his work Csikszentmihalyi describes a type of personality that can experience episodes of flow more easily and more often than most people. Because of difficulties involved in reproducing flow at will not much research has been made on this concept, but initial findings _do_ show some people achieve flow more easily than others.

People with an autotelic personality are said to be:

 * curious
 * persistent
 * not self-centered
 * often perform activities for intrinsic reasons

It is said that when a normal person pushes a big button saying "Don't press this" and gets electrocuted, they think to themselves "Heh, I shouldn't have done that." But when an engineer presses that same button they go "Huh, I wonder if that happens every time"

All programmers are engineers at heart, no matter what their formal qualifications say. 

Relentlessly hunting down bugs is a source of great pride for most programmers and many would sooner go without sleep than allow a bug to remain in production code. More experienced developers will often go to sleep once they realise they've started making silly mistakes, but they will never forget a bug that's taunting them.

Even a casual perusal of Github repositories will show that a lot of programmers indulge in so called pet projects - little programs developed for the fun of it, to sharpen the saw if you will. Interestingly enough, flow is much easier to experience on pet projects than large for-money behemoths.

It could be argued that programmers are very selfless people - the existence of communities like StackOverflow, large numbers of conferences where speakers share their knowledge for free, numerous blogs and free tutorials, not to mention the large opensource community that's given us something as powerful as the linux operating system and the stack most of the internet runs on. All of those are done holistically ... well, mostly. Everybody gains from having a good standing in the community.

As a group of people, programmers exhibit all the traits of an autotelic personality. This would suggest flow is much more prevalent amongst programmers than in other groups of people, which might also explain why we programmers are often perceived as night walkers.

## Is achieving flow easier at night?

Yes, flow is indeed much easier to achieve in the evening. At least for those of us who manage to think clearly and who still feel relatively rested. For many, the structure of their life makes this impossible - some then approach the night from its other end, others learn to work during the day.

### Decision fatigue

The biggest enemy to evening and night-time productivity is decision fatigue. 

Most people experiencing decision fatigue don't recognise it for what it is, but if you've ever felt well rested physically and still couldn't think clearly, like your brain was tired, you've experienced decision fatigue.

[Research](http://www.nytimes.com/2011/08/21/magazine/do-you-suffer-from-decision-fatigue.html) has shown that humans can only accept a limited amount of decisions every day, after that we usually go with the default action, or are so incapable of making a decision we can't perform the action at all.

Not only that, it's been shown that even the tiniest decision factors into the quota - everything from deciding what to eat for breakfast, to which outfit to wear and what websites to read now or later. This is why the checkout aisle in your supermarket is filled with tiny things you otherwise wouldn't have bought and why people instinctively want to "sleep on it" when making big decisions.

Depending on how a programmer's day is structured, working in the evening can be a godsend or a spaghetti code mess producing mistake. The important thing is to be well rested regardless of the time when you start working.

However, researchers at [where] have discovered a link between evenings and creativity, apparently we are more able to power through boring monotonous tasks in the morning and perform better on creative tasks in the evening. Perhaps because decision fatigue lowers our impulse control and we can "just go with it".

### Clear mind

Flow is marked by an intense, almost meditative, calm. No other thoughts can invade your brain than what pertains to the task at hand. Everything else ceases to exist.

But when things are hanging over your head, so to speak, achieving flow is nearly impossible for most people. The mental clarity and emotional calm just isn't there.

Whether it's an errand you still have to run, or an important email you mustn't forget to send. Perhaps there's just some worrying stuff going on and you aren't Irish enough not to worry about it. Sometimes you simply have an IRC chatroom open in a hidden window. 

If there's something tugging at your brain, you might as well forget about flow.

Perhaps the biggest thing everyone's got tugging on their brain is the anticipation of imminent distraction. You _know_ something is going to happen in an hour or two. Sometimes it's a big meeting, other times you have to be around to take a call - either way, it can be very distracting even if you do know when the distraction is going to happen.

Everyone knows those moments where it's 2:35 and you expect something to happen at 3:00. You try to get work done, but you keep looking at the clock every two minutes. Then you might as well check a tweet or two … when 3:00 rolls around you basically haven't done anything useful for almost half an hour.

Not knowing when, or even if, a distraction is going to happen only makes it worse. You're paying half attention to your code and half attention to your environment at all times. When a colleague sitting across the room says something, you immediately listen in, process what you've heard, decide it wasn't about you and get back to work.

You'd love to tune out completely, but sometimes it _is_ for you and you have to respond. Random rewards are after all the strongest behaviour creator in existence.

Something wonderful happens at night, though. There are no more distractions, at least there is no more threat of imminent distraction. Since everyone is asleep you can be fairly certain nobody is going to give you a call, nobody will ask you a random question, nothing interesting is going to happen on the internet.

For at least ten hours _nothing_ will be expected of you. Nothing. That's a lot of freedom right there.

### Habit

Have you ever had a habitual activity fall through? Say you go to the gym every Wednesday at six in the evening. Or you always watch a certain show on television at exactly 7PM every Thursday.

When something comes up and you can't do what you're used to it doesn't feel like you've gained an extra hour or two. No, you feel lost, like you suddenly don't know what to do with all this extra time you've been given. So you end up wasting it, clicking one more link on Reddit, or flicking through one more channel on the telly.

As they say, habit is an iron shirt. 

Getting used to something takes a concerted effort of a few weeks, but once the habit is built it's almost impossible to change. Just remember how odd it feels when you forget to brush your teeth in the morning!

It's the same thing with flow - it's simply easier at certain times in the day. This depends on a lot of things like how many other obligations you have, what the schedule of the people around you might be and even your internal cycles of activity, which tend to depend a lot on meal times.

But once you get used to working at a certain point in the day, suddenly your other habits start forming around these patterns instead of the other way around. It's a bit of a self-reinforcing pattern you see.

Since most programmers start very young, let's take a young programmer for example. Let's say they're still in high school.

This programmer needs to get up every morning at a predetermined time so they can get to class. They are stuck in class until, say, 3PM. They come home, their mum wants them to do a bunch of chores, there's homework to tend to and before they know it it's already 9PM or 10PM.

And now, finally, there's nothing hanging over their heads anymore. They can get to programming.

In a few years this person has come to college, there's much less external time constraints, but after many years of _starting_ coding in the evening they associate the activity with night-time. They simply can't get their mind to coding before 9PM anymore.

Thus, another night-time hacker is born. With years and piling pressure from the outside, their schedule will shift around, flow to and fro to meet other demands in their lives.

But when shit hits the fan and something _needs to get done_, I bet they will go back into their safe place and code all night.


## What keeps flow going?

### Panic mode

### Fulfillment


## Why is day-time particularly bad for flow?

Now that we can all agree the night is particularly good for flow, it is important to remember that this is not the only time when programmers can reach flow. Mornings, especially very early mornings, are a popular choice as well. Even though this is just approaching the night from a different end, the cultural baggage attached is different.

People who start work early in the morning, especially before dawn, are often seen as hard-working and commendable, while those who choose to work late into the night, often right until dawn, are often seen as lazy slobs who sleep the whole day away. Strange as it may seem.

Whether a programmer chooses late nights or early mornings, doesn't really change the goal - to avoid working on high intensity flow activities during the day.

The answer I got when asking programmers why they don't like working during the day sounds very asocial indeed - because other people are awake.

### Cost of interruption

There is a sort of ritual to getting in the flow. 

Usually the first thing people will do when they sit down to code is check Facebook, Twitter and email. Not always in that order, not always all of them, sometimes other social networks completely - Reddit, Hacker News and Stack Overflow are popular options.

Warm caffeinated beverages go very well with this sort of activity. Making them wastes little time, but introduces an impetus to keep procrastinating until you've finished the cup.

We call this procrastination, but the term carries connotations that aren't fully warranted. Don't think of it as putting off work, it's more like defragging one's brain. Making sure there are no more lingering thoughts in there, no notifications left unclicked, no important questions left unanswered.

After anywhere from a few minutes to an hour work can finally begin.

First, a programmer needs to make sure they are working off the latest version of the project. Then they must whatever issue tracking system they're using. Having a clear goal is after all paramount to achieving flow and getting anything done.

Next up, the work environment.

Swing by a programmer's computer some time and you will likely see a desktop littered with open windows, consoles, IDE's, text editors, documentation. Everything.

Unlike many (most?) people who use even modern computers as a single application environment and often maximize whatever software they are using to fill the whole screen, programmers are a different beast all together.

There's usually a text editor and a console or two, perhaps a debugger, a browser with some documentation is almost mandatory as well. Often all these tools will be unified in a single Integrated Development Environment (IDE), which is a mere euphemism for "A bunch of stuff, but in a single window".

Loading up a work environment like that takes time, not because our computers are slow, but because to know which tools you need, requires understanding what you're about to work on. Keeping things open helps so much that a session crash or a context switch to a different set of tools can be totally devastating to a programmer's productivity.

Then, the programmer must prime their mind.

Programs are a conversation between programmer and computer. Computer and user. The programmer's job is breaking down a problem into understandable bits and explaining the solution to the computer in such a way it can be executed perfectly every time. Or at least well enough.

Loading a program into your brain means learning its language. Functions are verbs, variables are nouns and there's plenty of things in between. Notes can help. Keeping tools open also helps. But nothing will get you over just how much brain power it takes to understand a software project.

Every time you lose sight of the whole system you have to build it again like constructing a glass palace. Once you understand the language, you have to arrange it in your mind so the space can be freely traversed, you can close your eyes and _see_ how different parts of the system affect each other.

Only after this stage has been reached is a programmer fully effective. Only then can they have any chance of reaching flow because they don't have to stop every five minutes to figure out how their code fits in the larger picture and whether it's even doing what it's supposed to.

When you interrupt a programmer, this glass palace can come crashing down in a shower of shattered glass. They have to start the whole process all over again and it's going to take a while before they're back to full steam.
