# Why programmers work at night

There's magic in the night-time. The peace and quiet, the internal serenity … There's just you, your work and an infinite abundance of time. You are alone.

As a society we know that smart, talented people work at night. Often in solitude, they solve problems mere mortals could only dream of. Look no further than your nearest book, movie or TV show about a lone genius ...

He is a youngish man. A bit of a loner. Doesn't get along with people terribly well. Likes to work at night or before dawn.

The stereotypical programmer is a friendlier version of that: likes staying up all night, lives off coffee and energy drinks, makes loud noises when disturbed, occasionally writes mean things on the internet.

## Culture

There is a lot to be said about the effect of culture on when people work. Especially when your idea of hard work is sitting behind a computer all day and doing tiny repetitive motions with your fingers.

One of the greatest benefits of being a programmer is that you can work whenever your mind feels at its best and most productive. You might often have to adjust to other team members either for collaboration or with the explicit purpose of avoiding unwanted interruption, but generally speaking, when you work depends on your personal preference alone.

A lot of professions can't afford this luxury - journalists have daily deadlines, sales people have to catch people in certain moods, farmers must feed animals at specific times and so on.

But it wasn't always like that.

One of the programmers I spoke to while researching this book had the pleasure of working on old mainframe systems a few decades ago. Back then, computing power was a scarce resource and carefully managed. To run a program on a mainframe you needed access. That access was much easier to get at night when other parts of your organisation weren't using the mainframe to do whatever.

So programmers preferred to stay up late rather than work during the day, IT was simply easier to get the computing resources they needed.

In the late 1980's and early 1990's computers became commoditised and everyone could have access right from their bedroom. But at the same time the internet came into wider use, amongst programmers especially.

I was lucky enough never to endure dial-up internet. Right around the time internet access was becoming ubiquitous so was ADSL; I managed to convince my parents "broadband" would be cheaper than internet phone bills. But I still remember a computer enthusiastic family friend explaining his internet strategy when I was about 7 years old.

> You see, internet use is very limited during the day. Somebody might call your house and your line will be busy. Or your parents will want to use the phone or something. Then in the evening everybody suddenly wants to connect and the internet becomes clogged up, really slow.

> So your best bet for the internet is after 10pm or 11pm, that's when you can reach full speed. Another option is at 6am or 7am, but that's really hard to get up for.

I was very impressed by all of this, didn't understand a thing and stuck to windows3.1 games on his computer. Those were fun. The internet did not sound like an interesting place at all.

A combination of these factors may have greatly contributed to the idea that "computer people" work at night. That they live off coffee and are generally night dwellers who avoid light at all cost. 

Of course programmers aren't doing anything to fight this notion - habitual bragging about how resilient you are to sleep and how you managed to stay up all night to fix a bug is widespread.

Remember, programmers work at night. Would a young upstart really dare call themselves a real programmer if they didn't enjoy working at night? Of course not. Plus there's all those movies saying that smart people work at night … and you want to be smart, right?

## The science of night owls

A growing body of research gives credence these ideas. People with higher general intelligence are likelier to prefer staying up late and people _are_ more creative in the evening than in the morning.

[A study published in 2006](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0191886999000549) studied USAF trainees in the sixth week of their training. The important part being that as a result of their training, all participants in the study lived the same lifestyle, ate the same food etc. Factors, which have been shown to affect circadian rhythms.

The study found that people who self-identified as preferring the evening also achieved higher scores in the different cognitive tests measuring things like memory and processing speed. Albeit the correlation was small, it was consistent. 

Interestingly enough, individuals self-identifying as evening types, achieved higher scores in the morning as well. This is despite the USAF population being skewed towards mornigness.

The study also mentions all other morningness-eveningness research would indicate a link between higher general intelligence and a preference for night owl behaviour. Arguing that the sample populations in those studies exhibited a skew towards eveningness and because they were done on university students, who generally have higher intelligence, this would indicate a positive link between the two.

The research I've found on this topic does not say much about whether being smarter means you will prefer evenings, or preferring evenings means you will be smarter.

[Another relevant study](http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/13546783.2011.625663) from 2011 looked at the difference in solving insight and analytic problems based on morningness-eveningness preference and when you are actually solving the problem.

Their findings indicate that people perform better at insight-based tasks when they are not at their best time. So a night owl is more creative in the morning, while a lark is more creative in the evening. One of the given explanations supported by a related experiment was that being tired inhibits ones ability to focus, which in turn makes you more capable of thinking widely, beyond the scope of already retrieved knowledge.

As expected, solving analytical problems shows a positive correlation between time preference and when you're actually solving a problem. Night owls perform better in the evening, larks in the morning. This is very likely due to the fact that peak activity time relates to when we are best able to focus.

All of this goes somewhat against two of the original hypotheses I proposed before writing this book - that of being more creative in the evening would only appear to be true for morning people, but it seems odd that programmers would habitually work in the evening if they were morning people. Especially since neutral people without a preference do not exhibit creativity gains depending on time of day.

The other hypothesis that finds itself on shaky ground is the idea that we better manage to focus when tired because a processing power limit is reached and we have no other choice but to focus lest no work get done at all. I will explore this further in the Sleep Science section of the book.

## Flow

> To do high, real good physics work you do need absolutely solid lengths of time, so that when you’re putting ideas together which are vague and hard to remember /../ it needs a lot of concentration

  ~ Richard Feynman, The Pleasure of Finding Things Out

Just like Feynman's physics example, programming is a process requiring deep thought and a lot of concentration. It's abstractions all the way down. The only way to do good programming is to become completely immersed, so focused you might forget to eat drink and sleep.

You need flow.

> Flow is the mental state of operation in which a person performing an activity is fully immersed in a feeling of energised focus, full involvement, and enjoyment in the process of the activity.

Flow was discovered in 1975 by Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi while he was observing artists who got so lost in their work they would forget to eat and drink and would even stop noticing the passage of time.

Flow is the natural state of the programmer.

Any programmer will tell you stories of the wonderful work they've done while in flow, in the zone, wired in or any of a number of euphemisms that all mean the same thing - the programmer had an interesting task, it was challenging, but not too much, and they were left alone to work.

A lot, if not most, of creative professions experience flow, but it's especially important for programmers. The systems we work on have become so complex they are impossible for an individual to understand fully.

It's like building a house of cards where every card is slightly bent and torn. You have to balance them carefully, keep all of them in mind when adding a new card and should a single card falter, everything will come tumbling down.

When a programmer works their brain is playing this delicate game of card house building. Unless fully immersed, the going will be tough, if not impossible.

More importantly, the work we do provides everything necessary to achieve flow:

 * challenging
 * offers immediate feedback
 * clear objectives
 * never really ends

It's very easy to get sucked into a programming task. You build the framework in your mind, start working, constantly receive feedback from the computer, make tweaks, beat one small problem after another until suddenly it's morning and birds are chirping outside the window. You're feeling slightly tired, quite hungry, a bit thirsty and confused as to where all the time has vanished off to.

Right now, if you've ever experienced flow, you are nodding in understanding. If not, you think I'm crazy and am talking complete nonsense. How could you not notice when you get hungry or tired!? Silly person.

Surely  you've played a video game before?

Video games are specifically designed to get players into a state of flow. To make them fully concentrated on the gaming experience and forget the world around them. The learning curve is always just steep enough to be interesting, the challenges are non-repetitive and you're having fun.

This is why we hear unfortunate stories of people forgetting to feed their children or starving themselves to death while playing.

Now imagine your job looked like that. A never-ending string of challenges you can solve with the tiniest bits of focused thinking.
