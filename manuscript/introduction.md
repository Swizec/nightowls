# Introduction - version 0.4

Hello, I am Book.

You already know the guy who created me from that foreword. You might think he's silly, but he's all right.

Anyway, I’m a great Book! You will like me. 

It's going to take about an hour, fifty-three minutes and nine seconds to read me through, but you can take it slow. Or fast. Either way, I suggest a nice cup of tea and a comfy chair.

I love programmers. Sometimes they prefer to be called developers, or software engineers, or computer scientists. But whatever _your_ favorite version likes to call themselves, go give them a hug. They're awesome folk!

They might seem a bit strange at first, but I'm going to help you be _the best_ person for programmers to be around. If you happen to be a programmer yourself, I'm going to tell you how to be the best programmer there is.

## Keep in touch

Swizec is starting a newsletter about the things from Book. He's going to share interesting things about productivity, programmers, office culture and stuff like that about twice a month.

Sign up at: [http://swiz.ec/nightowls-list](http://swiz.ec/nightowls-list)

You can also poke Swizec on Twitter as [@swizec](https://twitter.com/swizec) or send him an email at swizec@swizec.com. He loves hearing from people.

## Whom Book is for

You should read me if you are a programmer or have to deal with them a lot. If you've ever waited until 11am for one of them to show up at work, or couldn't get them into bed until 3am no matter how sexy you dressed, this book is for you!

If you're a mum or a dad and have a pup programmer in the house, don't worry. I'll tell you all about why they stay up all night and sleep through school. It's because they're doing awesome things in their spare time ;)

If one of your parents is a programmer and they keep making corny jokes like *"The two hard problems in computer science are cache invalidation, naming things, and off-by-one errors. Ha ha."*. I'll help you understand that too.

## What Book contains

I have roughly four sections.

First, I'm going to talk about whether programmers do in fact work at night (or they just like to _think_ they do). For some reason, they like to brag about how little sleep they got last night. Swizec is just like that!

Then I'm going to tell you _why_ they feel night time is best time. Some things in the day time just don't gel with those guys. Understanding how they work will help you keep those obstacles at a minimum.

There's going to be practical stuff, both for people around programmers, as well as for programmers themselves.  And the very last section might be called *"Lifestyle tips for top productivity"*.

Everything you read here has been tried by somebody: Either Swizec himself, or some of his close friends. None of those ideas that sound good on paper, but nobody can do! Only things that _work_ are allowed in here.

## What is not in Book

I am not a book of hard science. Take everything with a grain of salt. If something seems strange, tell Swizec. If something doesn't work for you, tell Swizec. If something sounds downright dangerous, tell Swizec.

You should consider me a collection of anecdotes, personal experiences and interpretations of scientific literature on the topic.

## How finished is Book

Swizec seems to have a life outside of Book, so it's taking him a while to finish. You might still find some notes to himself (usually inside square brackets) or sections that clearly haven't seen an editor yet. He's very sorry about that, and promises to finish things as soon as possible.

If you are reading me via [the Github repository](https://github.com/Swizec/nightowls), that's wonderful! Make sure to tell Swizec what's wrong! Github Issues exist for a reason.

If you're reading me via purchased pdf, that is _awesome_! You are a gentleman and a scholar and a great person to boot. Swizec asked me to say “thanks” for supporting the project.

Right now, I'm version 0.4.

My favorite sections are **About flow** and **Working with programmers**. There's some good scientific discussion about creativity and sleep habits in **Why programmers work at night**.

The section of tips _for_ programmers was mostly written during a road trip around Europe. It's all very interesting and is probably the most well-researched part of the book, but Swizec still needs to mark up the references and clean up the writing.

If you're into data, you should check out the preliminary analysis in **Do programmers work at night?**. Some 500,000 Github repositories were considered, but there's still much more data hiding in there.
